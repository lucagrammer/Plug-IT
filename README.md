## Web Application Design and Developement
This part of the project consists in the design and development of a website for Plug-IT.

Plug-IT is a medium-sized Italian company operating in the ICT sector that needs a website to make itself known and to show its offers. The system must show all the information relating to the areas (more than 3) in which it operates and the related services (more than 30) it offers.
In addition to the general description of the company and its contacts, all information about the people (more than 20) working at Plug-IT must be shown in detail.
In particular, some relationship must be evident on the website:
- People are related to areas (and vice versa) in different ways, e.g., because they are responsible for an area or because they work in an area
- People are related to services (and vice versa) in different ways, e.g., because they are project manager or because they are reference for assistance for a service
- Services are related to the areas they belong to (and vice versa)

#### The files of the final Design Document can be found in the [Design Document Folder](https://github.com/lucagrammer/HypermediaProject/tree/master/Design%20Document/Deliverable).
